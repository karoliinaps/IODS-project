# About the project

This is my first ever R Markdown document and I'm super excited about starting to use R Markdown. This has been created for the  Uni of Helsinki course *Introduction to Open Data Science*, held in autumn 2017 in period 2. The course content sounds very useful for my research and I hope I will be able to start using the tools and skills straight away by doing some simple *data analysis and visualisation*. My **github repository** is https://github.com/karoliinaps/IODS-project.
